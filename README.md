## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
By default, it also includes a service worker so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed!\

### `yarn preview`

Locally preview production build.\
